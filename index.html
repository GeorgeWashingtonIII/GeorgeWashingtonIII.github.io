    <h2> Lyrics of the song Home</h2>

    <p class="home">Home
    <p class="home">A place where I can go
    <p class="home">To take this off my shoulders
    <p class="home">Someone take me home
    <p class="home">Home
    <p class="home">A place where I can go
    <p class="home">(To take this off my shoulders)
    <p class="home">(Someone take me home)
    <p class="home">(Someone take me)
    <p class="home">Look, I didn't power through the struggle
    <p class="home">Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
    <p class="home">And interrupt the vision
    <p class="home">After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
    <p class="home">All these miles, feet, inches
    <p class="home">They can't add up to the distance
    <p class="home">That I have been through, just to get to
    <p class="home">A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
    <p class="home">I still ache from trying to keep pace
    <p class="home">Somebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith
    <p class="home">Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
    <p class="home">How did I lose it when I was right there?
    <p class="home">Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
    <p class="home">Tell me why the world never fights fair
    <p class="home">I'm trying to find
    <p class="home">Home
    <p class="home">A place where I can go
    <p class="home">To take this off my shoulders
    <p class="home">Someone take me home
    <p class="home">Home
    <p class="home">(A place where I can go)
    <p class="home">(To take this off my shoulders)
    <p class="home">(Someone take me home)
    <p class="home">{It's been a long time coming}
    <p class="home">(Someone take me)
    <p class="home">Home, ho-o-o-o-me
    <p class="home">Home, home
    <p class="home">Someone take me
    <p class="home">Home, ho-o-o-o-me
    <p class="home">Home, home
    <p class="home">Look, I've been through so much pain
    <p class="home">And it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face
    <p class="home">'Cause there's madness on my brain
    <p class="home">So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
    <p class="home">Gotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at
    <p class="home">I need the (memory)
    <p class="home">In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
    <p class="home">And if I have any (enemies)
    <p class="home">To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe
    <p class="home">Now tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
    <p class="home">How did I lose it when I was right there?
    <p class="home">Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
    <p class="home">Tell me why the world never fights fair
    <p class="home">I'm trying to find
    <p class="home">Home
    <p class="home">(A place where I can go)
    <p class="home">(To take this off my shoulders)
    <p class="home">Someone take me home
    <p class="home">Someone take me
    <p class="home">I found no cure for the loneliness
    <p class="home">I found no cure for the sickness
    <p class="home">Nothing here feels like home
    <p class="home">Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
    <p class="home">(I found no cure for the loneliness)
    <p class="home">(I found no cure for the sickness)
    <p class="home">Nothing here feels like home
    <p class="home">Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
    <p class="home">(Someone take me)
    <p class="home">Home, ho-o-o-o-me
    <p class="home">Take me home
    <p class="home">Home, home (take me home)
    <p class="home">Someone take me
    <p class="home">Home, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)
    <p class="home">Nothing here feels like home
    <p class="home">Home, home
    <p class="home">(Someone take me)
